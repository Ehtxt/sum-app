Project: Indices
Warm-up assignment to practice arrays in C++.
Given an array of integers `nums` and a target, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.
# Example:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9  
Output: [0,1]

Used an unordered_map for O(n) solution.
Space complexity O(n).
